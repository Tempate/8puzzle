# 8puzzle

This project is a solver, generator, and checker for the game [8-puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle). It's written in plain Haskell — it's my first Haskell project — and it's licensed under GPLv3+. All comments and feedback are appreciated; feel free to leave an issue and I'll reply as soon as possible.
